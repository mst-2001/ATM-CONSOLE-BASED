# ATM-CONSOLE-BASED
This ATM simulation project is a simple Python-based program that enables users to perform basic banking operations through a command-line interface. The program allows users to withdraw and deposit money, generate a secure PIN, and check their account balance with a mini statement. It ensures secure transactions by requiring PIN authentication and supports PIN generation for new accounts. The program also includes error handling to prevent invalid inputs and improve user experience. Built using Python 3, this project is easy to run and modify. Users can clone the repository from GitHub, navigate to the project directory, and execute the script. Contributions are welcome, making it a great project
